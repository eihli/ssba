#+TITLE: Main

Assuming my math is correct and there's no bugs in my code, I think I'm able to allocate 50,000 megabytes on my machine? 51,000 is a segfault. I've only got 32 gig of ram and 15 gig of swap.

Why is that? I would expect a max of 47gb. Is this a difference between 1024 bytes per kibibyte vs 1000 bytes per kilobyte?

Also, ~free~ doesn't report any difference.
